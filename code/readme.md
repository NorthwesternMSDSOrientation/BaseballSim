# Functional Code Directory

This folder is for all code related to your baseball simulation project.

## What to Include

- Main simulation scripts and modules  
- Data processing and cleaning scripts  
- Model training and evaluation code  
- Utility functions and helpers  
- Any other code used to generate results or manage the simulation pipeline  

## Suggested Structure

Organize your code in a way that makes it easy to understand and run. Here are some examples based on language:

### Python Example
```
code/
  data_pipeline.py
  simulation_engine.py
  model_training.py
  utils/
    init.py
    helpers.py
  tests/
    test_simulation.py
```

### R Example
```
code/
  data_pipeline.R
  simulation_engine.R
  model_training.R
  utils/
    helpers.R
  tests/
    test_simulation.R
```

### Go Example
```
code/
  main.go
  simulation/
    engine.go
    stats.go
  data/
    pipeline.go
  tests/
    simulation_test.go

```

**Notes**
Use subfolders (e.g., utils/, tests/) to keep your code organized.
Include a README or comments in your scripts to explain how to run your code and what each file does.
