# Results Directory

This folder is for storing the outputs of your baseball simulation runs.

## What to Include

You may consider including the following types of files:

- **Simulation Summaries:**  
  Aggregated results from thousands of simulated games (e.g., win/loss records, average scores, probability distributions).

- **Detailed Game Logs:**  
  Play-by-play or pitch-by-pitch logs for selected games or for all simulations.

- **Statistical Reports:**  
  Metrics such as team and player performance, run distributions, and other statistical analyses.

- **Visualizations:**  
  Plots, charts, or dashboards summarizing simulation outcomes (e.g., histograms of runs scored, win probability graphs).

- **Sample Output Files:**  
  Example:  
  - `simulation_summary.csv`
  - `detailed_game_logs.csv`
  - `metrics_report.html`
  - `results_visualization.png`

## Notes

- Organize your results clearly so they are easy to interpret and review.
- Include a brief description or README for any complex output files or visualizations.
