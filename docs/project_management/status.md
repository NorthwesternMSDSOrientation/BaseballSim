# Status Log - Example

This is a sample status log for a Baseball Simulator project.

## Status Report

- May 18: Prompted AI to write data-cleaning function; fixed edge-case in row filtering.
- May 19: Reviewed and merged pull request for simulation engine.
- May 20: Updated backlog and WBS after team meeting.

# Status

## Format
Status should be in the form of a list of notes or summaries that the agent performed furing each iteration/round. It should include any ideas, notes, items of interest, etc. It should be a summary of work performed. A status should also include plans for what the agent thinks it should do next.

## Status Report

### Iteration 1 (2025-05-18)

**Summary of Work Performed:**
- Reviewed project management artifacts and CSV backlog.
- Synthesized a clear backlog management process for future contributors and agents.
- Created a structured, sectioned backlog checklist in `activity_list.md` with unique IDs for each task.
- Generated a detailed backlog table in `backlog.md` with all relevant columns, cross-referenced by ID, and linked to specs, roadmap, and WBS.
- Added essential infrastructure/process items (e.g., CI/CD, documentation, code review) to ensure project completeness and maintainability.
- Ensured all backlog items are traceable and actionable for future development.

**Ideas/Notes:**
- The checklist and table system will help agents and contributors track progress and maintain alignment with project goals.
- Linking backlog items to specs, roadmap, and WBS increases traceability and clarity.
- Additional backlog items (infrastructure, onboarding, etc.) will help streamline future development and onboarding.

**Plan for Next Iteration:**
- Review and refine backlog items for completeness and clarity.
- Begin breaking down larger tasks into smaller, actionable subtasks if needed.
- Start prioritizing tasks for the first development sprint.
- Set up initial Go module and Hugo documentation structure if not already present.

### Iteration 2 (2025-05-18)

**Summary of Work Performed:**
- Reviewed and confirmed the organization of the `internal/scraper` folder and its Go module setup.
- Updated the `scraper.go` script to ensure all output CSVs are saved in the `/data/` folder and are clearly named with the team and table name for clarity.
- Verified that the script supports both local HTML files and live URLs for both Cubs and Sox.
- Provided usage instructions and recommendations for further improvements (such as output directory flag and documentation).
- Confirmed that `go.mod` and `go.sum` are correct and will be managed automatically by Go tooling.

**Ideas/Notes:**
- The scraper is now ready for extracting all tables for both teams and saving them in an organized way.
- Future improvements could include filtering for only relevant tables or adding more robust error handling and logging.

**Plan for Next Iteration:**
- Run the scraper for both Cubs and Sox data sources and verify the output CSVs.
- Review the extracted data for completeness and usability in the simulation engine.
- Begin designing data loading and validation routines for the Go application.

### Iteration 3 (2025-05-18)

**Summary of Work Performed:**
- Defined the optimal end state for simulation-ready player data.
- Identified all variables needing parsing, normalization, or dummy variable creation.
- Added new backlog and WBS items for the data_prepper module and data normalization.
- Updated the encyclopedia with explicit data prep requirements.
- Implemented position normalization, position flexibility metric, and boolean columns for each position in the data_prepper module.

**Plan for Next Iteration:**
- Implement the data_prepper module.
- Begin processing raw CSVs and outputting clean, normalized data.
- Validate output and update documentation as needed.
- Batch process all team/player CSVs with the new logic.
- Validate output and update documentation as needed.

### Iteration 4 (2025-05-19)

**Summary of Work Performed:**
- Completed robust batch processing for all player, roster, and fielding CSVs for both Cubs and White Sox.
- Implemented pre-processing for height fields to avoid CSV parse errors.
- Added logic for position flexibility and boolean columns.
- Added and confirmed schedule CSVs for both teams are present for next phase.
- Handedness extraction is now robust for both stat and roster tables.
- Updated project management artifacts to reflect completed and next tasks.

**Plan for Next Iteration:**
- Implement schedule CSV normalization and cleaning.
- Ensure schedule data is ready for simulation scheduling logic.
- Validate all outputs and update documentation as needed.

**Handoff Note for Next Agent:**

- All player, roster, and fielding CSVs for Cubs and White Sox have been cleaned and normalized.
- Height fields are now pre-processed to avoid CSV parse errors.
- Position flexibility and boolean columns are included in all relevant outputs.
- Both Cubs and White Sox schedule CSVs are now present (`2025_schedule.csv` for each team).
- **Your next task:**  
  - Implement schedule CSV normalization and cleaning in the data_prepper module.
  - Ensure the cleaned schedule files are output to `data/clean` and are ready for use by the simulation engine.
  - Update project management docs and `readme.md` as needed after schedule processing.
- See the updated backlog and status for more details on what’s done and what’s next.
